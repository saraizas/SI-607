        for each district based on its random latitude and longitude, and updates the district's 
        `censusTract` attribute.

        Note
        ----
        The method fetches data from "https://geo.fcc.gov/api/census/area" and assumes that 
        `randomLat` and `randomLong` attributes of each district are already set.

        The function `fetch` is an internal helper function that performs the actual API request.

        In the api call, check if the response.status_code is 200.
        If not, it might indicate the api call made is not correct, check your api call parameters.

        If you get status_code 200 and other code alternativly, it could indicate the fcc webiste is not 
        stable. Using a while loop to make anther api request in fetch function, until you get the correct result. 

        Important
        -----------
        The order of the API call parameter has to follow the following. 
        'lat': xxx,'lon': xxx,'censusYear': xxx,'format': 'json' Or
        'lat': xxx,'lon': xxx,'censusYear': xxx

        This method requests income data from the ACS 5-Year Data via the U.S. Census Bureau's API 
        for the year 2018. It then maps these incomes to the corresponding census tracts and updates 
        the median income attribute of each district in `self.districts`.

        Note
        ----
        The method assumes that the `censusTract` attribute for each district is already set. It updates 
        the `medIncome` attribute of each district based on the fetched income data. If the income data 
        is not available or is negative, the median income is set to 0.

        After creating the list, dump it to a json file with the inputted name.
        You should name the cache file as redlines_cache.json

        Analyzes the qualitative descriptions of each district category (A, B, C, D) and identifies the

        This method aggregates the qualitative descriptions for each district category, splits them into
        words, and computes the frequency of each word. It then identifies and returns the 10 most 
        common words that are unique to each category, excluding common English filler words.

            A list containing four lists, each list containing the 10 most common words for each 
            district category (A, B, C, D). The first list should represent grade A, and second for grade B,etc.
            The words should be in the order of their frequency.

        Notes
        -----
        - Common English filler words such as 'the', 'of', 'and', etc., are excluded from the analysis.
        - The method ensures that the common words are unique across the categories, i.e., no word 
        appears in more than one category's top 10 list.
        - Regular expressions could be used for word splitting to accurately capture words from the text.
        - Counter from collections could also be used.

        a rank to each district, with 1 being the highest income district.

        Note
        ----
        The rank is assigned based on the position in the sorted list, so the district with the highest
        median income gets a rank of 1, the second-highest gets 2, and so on. Ties are not accounted for;
        each district will receive a unique rank.

        Important:
        If you do the extra credit, you need to edit the __init__ of DetroitDistrict adding another arg "rank" with
        default value to be None. Not doing so might cause the load cache method to fail if you use the ** operator in load cache.

        This method fetch the total and Black populations for each census tract in Michigan from 
        the U.S. Census Bureau's API, like the median income data.  It then calculates the percentage of Black residents in each tract
        and assigns this value to the corresponding district percent attribute.

        Note
        ----
        The method assumes that the census tract IDs in the district data match those used by the Census Bureau.
        The percentage is rounded to two decimal places. If the Black population is zero, the percentage is set to 0. 
        Elif the total population is zero, the percentage is set to 1.
