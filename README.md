# SI-607
Intermediate Programming (2024)

This course is to build upon the foundation provided by 506 and prepare students for more advanced courses that require programming skills. In particular, students in 507 will further develop core programming and software development skills, including: applying basic algorithms and basic data structures, accessing and processing data, debugging, testing, incorporating external libraries, and maintaining a functioning development environment. By the end of this course, students should be comfortable writing substantial programs to address common problems in data processing and analysis.


This repository contains projects assigned this past semester covering things such as recursion, binary tree graphs, basic data structures, and more.
