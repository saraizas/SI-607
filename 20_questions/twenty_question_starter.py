            added to refine the tree.

        Handle gameplay when a leaf node is reached in the decision tree. This method is called when 
        the game's traversal reaches a leaf node, indicating a guess at the player's thought. 
        If the guess is incorrect, the method will
        1. prompts the player for the correct answer 
        2. prompts the player for a distinguishing question

        4. creating a new node in the tree for future gameplay. It should call self.createNode(...)

        Parameters
        ----------
        curNode : tuple
            The current leaf node in the decision tree. A leaf node is represented as a tuple with the guessed 
            object as the first element and two `None` elements, signifying that it has no further branches.

        Returns
        -------
        tuple
            The updated node based on user input. If the player's response indicates that the initial guess was 
            incorrect, this method returns a new node that includes the correct answer and a new question 
            differentiating it from the guessed object. If the guess was correct, it simply returns the unchanged 
            `curNode`.
        
        Notes
        -----
        The method interacts with the player to refine the decision tree. It's a crucial part of the learning 
        aspect of the game, enabling the tree to expand with more nuanced questions and answers based on 
        player feedback.

        The method uses the 'saveTree' function to perform the recursive traversal and writing of the tree
